                    <p>
                        In this chapter, we would be accessing <b>negative impacts</b> of different tectonic hazards on natural and human systems.
                        We would be exploring the following impacts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Destruction of Ecosystems (Natural)</li>
                            <li>Destroys properties and infrastructure (Human)</li>
                            <li>Disrupts services (Human)</li>
                            <li>Causes injuries and fatalities (Human)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>We would be looking into earthquakes then into volcanic eruptions. This section is pretty common sense in my opinion.</p>

                    <h2>2.4.3 Impact of Soil Liquefaction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Liquefaction refers to transforming of the soil to become a thick fluid after violent shaking where it <b>become more saturated, loose soil</b>.

                    <img src={ liquefaction } alt="Liquefaction Process"/>
                    <p>
                        The shaking of the ground causes the soil to loose its porous structure, turning into something like sand - and I believe we can all understand how sand works.

                        During a violent earthquake, cracks form on steep slopes, making the rocks and soil lose.
                        When the soil is loose enough, they would slide downslope (not enough friction to hold things together).
                        Essentially, the landslide <b>buries things</b> and introduces soil where it shouldn't be.

                        Example: 2008 Sichuan (汶川地震), M<sub>w</sub> 7.9<br/>
                        It triggered over 15k landslides, destroying many buildings and infrastructure.
                        It caused about 20k deaths.

                    <h2>2.4.5 Impact of Tsunamis</h2>
                    <p>
                        Tsunami refers to a series of waves caused by an underwater earthquake.
                        The density of water is higher, the energy transfer is often more efficient.
                        Therefore, tsunamis can travel a longer distance and loose less energy along the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tsunamis are formed when:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Undersea earthquake occurs, leading to displacement of water.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Water displaced is lifted higher, forming large waves.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The water moves at high speeds, creating destructive waves.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When the water gets shallower, the waves increase in height, causing more damage.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        It is important to note that the tsunamis require the displacement of water, and the water remains the same.
                        So the <b>water from the beaches recede from the shores</b>, filling in the void caused by the displacement.
                        This can be used as a warning for a possible tsunami.
                    </p>
